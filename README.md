# DEDIS Main Document Repository

This repository is intended to hold working documents
created or maintained by the DEDIS group that are
intended to be public or under "open source" development,
and have no better place to be.
Some documents may well start here and move elsewhere later.

## Main repositories

- [Cothority](https://github.com/dedis/cothority) is the
public-facing repository where apps reside that can be used directly by the public.
- [Kyber cryptographic library](https://github.com/dedis/kyber) is used throughout
the cothority for all cryptographic functions that need more than a simple `Seal`
and `Open`.
- [Cothority template](https://github.com/dedis/cothority_template) is useful
to PhD students and others who want to develop their own protocols, services,
and applications such that they can be integrated into the cothority project.
- [Cothority network library](https://github.com/dedis/onet) holds all the
basic networking code used by the cothority framework.

## IETF drafts

The two active documents the DEDIS group is working on at the moment are:

- [Collective Edwards-Curve Signature
  Algorithm](https://github.com/dedis/doc/cosi)
- [Leakage-Hardened Encryption via Padded Uniform Random Blobs
  (PURBs)](https://github.com/dedis/doc/purb)
