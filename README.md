# DEDIS Documents repository

This repository is intended to hold working documents
created or maintained by the DEDIS group that are
intended to be public or under "open source" development,
and have no better place to be.
Some documents may well start here and move elsewhere later.

The two active documents the DEDIS group is working on at the moment are:

- [Collective Edwards-Curve Signature
  Algorithm](https://github.com/dedis/doc/cosi)
- [Leakage-Hardened Encryption via Padded Uniform Random Blobs
  (PURBs)](https://github.com/dedis/doc/purb)
